\usage{
DIALOGUE.plot(
  R,
  results.dir = "~/Desktop/DIALOGUE.results/",
  filename,
  pheno = NULL,
  mark.samples = NULL,
  metadata = NULL,
  d = 1,
  MCPs = 1:R$k["DIALOGUE"]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{DIALOGUE output}

\item{results.dir}{the directory where the PDF figure file will be located}

\item{pheno}{(optional) the name of a binary feature of interest to visualize in relation to the MCPs.}
}
\description{
Plot DIALOGUE results.
The resulting plots will show the cell-type-specific components
of each multicellular program as a function of its other components;
and the composition of each multicellular program, depicting how many of its genes
are cell-type-specific, and how many are shared across multiple cell types.
}
\details{
In case there is a specific feature or phenotype of interest DIALOGUE will plot the MCP
expression when stratifying the cells according to that classification.
}
\examples{
# Run DIALOGUE
R<-DIALOGUE.run(rA,results.dir = "~/Desktop/Results/",plot.flag = F)
# Plot the results
DIALOGE.plot(R,results.dir = "~/Desktop/Figures/",pheno = R$pheno)
# Alternatively
R<-DIALOGUE.run(rA,results.dir = "~/Desktop/Results/",plot.flag = T)
